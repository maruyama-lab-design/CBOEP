# Generators of Negative enhancer-promoter pairs, CBMF (Class Balanced negative set by Maximum-Flow) and CBGS (Class Balanced negative set by Gibbs Sampling)

This repository contains files related to our methods, CBMF and CBGS, which generate a set of negative enhancer-promoter interactions (EPIs) from a set of positive EPIs. 
The implementations of the methods are `cbmf.py` and `cbgs.py` in the top directory. 

# Datasets
CBMF and CBGS require a positive EPIs set as input to generate a negative dataset.

The resulting negative sets generated by the methods from BENGI positive sets and 
positive sets used in the work of TargetFinder are stored in 
directory ```input_to_neg_generator```.

If you want to generate negative EPI sets from a positive EPI set,
please note that 
the positive set should be in the csv format with the following columns:

| Column | Description |
| :---: | --- |
| ```label``` | Numeric ```1``` for positive EPI, ```0``` for negative EPI |
| ```enhancer_distance_to_promoter``` | Distance between the enhancer and the promoter |
| ```enhancer_chrom``` | Chromosome number of the enhancer |
| ```enhancer_start``` | Start position of the enhancer |
| ```enhancer_end``` | End position of the enhancer |
| ```enhancer_name``` | Name of the enhancer, such as `GM12878\|chr16:88874-88924` |
| ```promoter_chrom``` | Chromosome number of the promoter |
| ```promoter_start``` | Start position of the promoter |
| ```promoter_end``` | End position of the promoter |
| ```promoter_name``` | Name of the promoter, such as `GM12878\|chr16:103009-103010`|

If you want to use an EPI set to an EPI predictor in /EPI_predictor,
the reference genome version shold be GRCh37/hg19.

## CBMF Argument
---

| Argument | Default value | Description |
| :---: | :---: | ---- |
| ```-input``` ||Path to the input EPI dataset.|
| ```-output``` ||Path to the output EPI dataset|
| ```-dmax``` |2,500,000|Upper bound of enhancer-promoter distance for newly generated negative EPIs.|
| ```-dmin``` |0|Lower bound of enhancer-promoter distance for newly generated negative EPIs.|
